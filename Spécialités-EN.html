          <h2 class="soustitre">Chichi-frégis of course !</h2> 
  
                <p>Chichi-frégis are the most famous specialty in all of Marseille. Everyone in Marseille knows what a fuss is. Although you can find frills in the city center of Marseille, it is in the 3 chichis shacks of L'Estaque that you should taste this little non-dietary pleasure that is often confused with Churros. The big difference with the churros is that the Churros is twisted, thin and short: the Chichi is thick, puffy and it measures about 8 inches. It can be eaten plain, barely crunchy on the top and very airy inside, rolled in sugar, garnished with hazelnut paste, or even covered with whipped cream. It is part of what we now call Street Food but it was invented in the 1930s and it was the workers in the tile factories and factories of Estaque who popularized it. They ate it standing, under a tree, or in the harbor. A real pleasure break!
        
                    The Chichi has become over the years, a goal of stroll: for many Marseilles, the Sunday exit passes by the Estaque where one stops back from swimming on the Blue Coast (Carry, Sausset etc ... ). Almost a must for those who will tell their friends about their perfect day!

          <h2 class="soustitre2">Without forgetting the "panisses" !</h2> 
  
                <p>Panisses are a must with chichi-frégis. Made from chickpea flour, à l'Estaque, it is sold in the form of slices 2 cm thick, already cut and fried. Often by the dozen, sprinkled with fleur de sel and pepper. They can be enjoyed standing or on the terraces of the Estaque cafes, in a paper cone. In general, the Marseillais always take panisses with their fuss when coming into the neighborhood. The “chichi / panisses” combination is “The” specialty to try in this district of Marseille.
