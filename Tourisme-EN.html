                <p>Located at the northern end of Marseille, just before the Corbières marina and the Quai de la Lave, the Port de l'Estaque is Marseille's third marina and also a fishing port. The latter allowed the creation of the fishermen's stand. Installed a few hours each day with usually only one merchant per day, it sells freshly caught fish and seafood.
                But the port of Estaque is not just a professional fishing port, fishing for amateurs and enthusiasts are also common there. SNEM (Société Nautique Estaque Mourepiane) organizes five fishing competitions per year, highlighting support fishing and rock fishing.

                <p>The Corbière viaduct, built in 1915 according to the plans of the architect Paul Séjourné (1851-1939), is a masonry bridge 226.62 meters long, 27.18 meters high and 9.5 meters wide . Overlooking the only small beach in the northern districts of Marseille, it has 6 main arches with an opening of 20 meters, and 3 small arches on each foredeck. The old road from Marseille to Martigues, or “route du Rove”, passes under the first arch on the Marseille side, and a branch of this road towards the beach passes under the neighboring arch. This viaduct is a railway bridge still used for a TER Provence Alpes Côte d´Azur connecting Miramas to Estaque, a line known as the Côte Bleue line, allowing you to admire the sea.

                <p>It is an annual event that brings together young and old. Among the traditional Provençal games, water jousting is certainly one of the most spectacular and oldest. The Tàrgo provençalo, or Provençal nautical jousting, is the classic method practiced on the French Mediterranean coast and supervised by the French Federation of Jousting and Nautical Rescue (FFJSN) on a national scale. The Provençal joust cultivates its particularisms through the earthiness and the extreme codification of its demonstrations, its frank and virile attacks, always accompanied by sonorous dives. The Provençal joust is a digest of medieval honor, of village community feast, but also an agonistic response to the aggression of contemporary life ... It is considered to be the most violent method of all, which in no way frightens people. knights of tintaine ...

                <p>A historic monument since 1993, this neo-Moorish villa built from 1902 for Pierre Leclerc, a former tailor-maker, passionate about Orientalism, who had a storefront in Marseille, is one of the rare surviving witnesses of neo-Moorish architecture in vogue in Marseille and on the Provencal coast at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.
                According to family oral tradition, the villa project was inspired by the vision of a model of the Turkish pavilion at the 1900 Universal Exhibition in Paris, the work of architect René Dubuisson.
                The villa was opened once on the occasion of the Heritage Days in 1991. In front of the surge of visitors, the family panicked, not being prepared for such a success. So the villa never opened its doors again.

          <h2 class="soustitre7">The Boules!</h2> 
                <p>“Do you shoot or do you point?”, An emblematic phrase that resonates on every Boules court. This timeless game, born in Provence, brings together all generations. Tradition says that Marseille has as many boules grounds as there are villages and Estaque is no exception to the rule. Pétanque holds no secrets for anyone. The Marseillais particularly like going to strike a few boules, in this sport where, like a symbol, the 13 is synonymous with victory. If Boules has taken on an international scale with the organization each year of tournaments such as “la Marseillaise” or “Le Provençal 13”, it is also a sport that is practiced in the family environment around a good meal and 'a good aperitif. Try Boules and you buy into it.
